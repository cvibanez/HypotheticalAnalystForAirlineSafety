# Different Visualizations for Airline Safety from a Hypothetical Airline Data Analyst
## Data Presentation and Visualization

### Introduction
This project was for a data presentation and visualization course at Bellevue University. The projectâ€™s goal was to tell a story about airline safety using different data presentation and visualization techniques using publicly available data on airline, travel, and tourism.  Project tasks are created from the hypothetical perspective of an airline data analyst.  NOTE: I do not work for Southwest airlines and this was just a hypothetical scenario.
